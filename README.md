# ConversationalUiAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project accompanies a [tutorial]() on building a conversational UI in React using Stream Chat API and KendoReact COnversational UI components.

## Set Up

1. Clone and set up the [token server](https://github.com/pmbanugo/stream-chat-boilerplate-api) by following the instruction on that repository.

2. Clone this repo and run `npm install`.
3. Run `ng serve -o` to start the app.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
